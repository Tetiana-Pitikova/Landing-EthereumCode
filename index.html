                    <p>Unlike Bitcoin, it is very customizable and can be programmed to create things that no one can take down. You can program it to make services, games, apps, and other items that no one has control over.</p>

                <p>Bitcoin came first as a cryptocurrency, where it used an open market and decentralized system to start controlling value and making trades. Ethereum came soon after and saw an opportunity to expand the system.</p>

                        <p><b>Ethereum Code is powered by its own currency, called ether, which is the currency that can be spent on Ethereum applications. It is a cryptocurrency that has a few differences from Bitcoin, and here are some of those differences.</b></p>
                        <p>First, it is really yours. The ETH currency is really yours and can exist in your wallet without any other repercussions or third parties proving its legitimacy. It is secured by cryptography, meaning that your wallet and your transactions are all secured on the website and in various other places. The payments and trades from Ethereum Code are peer-to-peer, without any centralized power like a bank getting in the way and taking a cut. It’s a lot like calling up a friend and giving them cash hand to hand, except with Ethereum you can do it whenever and wherever you want.</p>
                        <p>Finally, you also don’t need to have a bank or any other information to start using ether. Rather than needing a bank account and a lot of personal information, as the Ethereum Code community is based on peer-to-peer value and ease of use. All you need is a stable internet connection, and you can get started using Ethereum!</p>

                    <div class="acor-body">
                        <p>Smart contracts are not contracts between two groups of people, but rather a program that runs whenever a certain set of variables are met. They are automatic and simply work as programmed, and it’s almost like a vending machine.</p>
                        <p>Whenever you hit a certain button on a vending machine, you receive a result (the snack being released). No matter what happens or what changes are made, you should always be able to hit a button and get the desired result.</p>

                    <div class="acor-body">
                        <p>Smart contracts have that same logic, and they look for the same actions inside of the blockchain. They then trigger those actions and give you the desired result. If you can learn to write the programming language, then you can create smart contracts and use them for your benefit.
                        </p>
                        <p>Like everything else that uses Ethereum, you can also customize the contracts as well, thinking of them like open APIs. That means you can connect more contracts to your contract, giving the AI more steps to follow. If you want to, you can even have the AI go through several different contracts, with each one triggering the other on a loop.</p>

                    <div class="acor-body">
                        <p>Finally, smart contracts are internal systems. The trading robot only uses the data that is provided by you whenever you create the contract. This keeps things fair because outside data doesn’t just give you an advantage, but it also clutters up the system. Still, having a connection to the outside world can stop the AI from making a bad decision, and it lets you participate in prediction markets. </p>

                    <div class="acor-body">
                        <p>Prediction markets use oracles whenever events are bet on. If you are a gambler you can bet your Ether on an event, like who might win a certain baseball game. The oracle taps into the data about the game, sees who won, and then automatically handles the wagers for all those who have participated. </p>
                        <p>Using oracles is a little complicated and requires you to have a bit of knowledge about cryptocurrency trading, but if you have that knowledge it can open up a whole new world of betting!</p>

                            <p>The network is also decentralized due to the nature of Ethereum. There are no governments or institutions that control Ether, so none of your transactions or other items can be canceled by a third party. There’s a secure and built-in guarantee with every single purchase. Instead, you have the promise that your funds can change hands only when the deal has been finalized.</p>
                            <p>The largest benefit of the Ethereum Code is that it is so easy to use. Rather than having to struggle to open your bank account, you just need to use the decentralized finance system to gain access.</p>
                            <p>Then you can send money, receive it, make trades, and communicate with others all through the Ethereum Code website.</p>

                            <p>The main benefit of our service is the decentralized financial system, which is an open system that is different from the traditional finance system the rest of the world uses. The entire Ethereum Code system is open-source and programmable, allowing for extreme levels of customizability.</p>
                            <p>A decentralized system gives you total control and visibility when it comes to your money, while also allowing you to use that as an alternative to your local currency. This system is also accessible to anyone who has an internet connection, meaning that you can easily get into the crypto-economy. The control also extends to how your money is moved around.</p>
                            <p>Unlike traditional banks, the transition of money from one place to another is not only instant but also anonymous. You can look at the product’s data before you buy it, scrutinizing its code to make sure that you are getting the best deal with Ethereum Code.</p>

                    <p>After your account is set up you need to make a deposit into it. The minimum deposit for Ethereum Code is $250, and once you have the deposit you can set started with a live trading session. The application is very easy to use, and new users just need to follow on screen prompts and click on a few buttons to start making trades.</p>

                    <p>With a free Ethereum wallet, you can choose from a wide variety of wallet providers for all cryptocurrency experience levels. Then it is up to you to take care of your wallet and take responsibility for the money that is inside of it.</p>

It is a highly customizable blockchain based program. However, it’s not just about cryptocurrencies, but also supports trading other items using the same code.</b></p>
                        <p>If you think of Ethereum less as a cryptocurrency and more of a digital resource, then you’ve got the right idea. Basically, if you have the right program in place you can turn anything into a non-fungible token (NFT) which is one of the currencies used by the Ethereum Code.</p>

                    <p>Non-fungible tokens are powered by smart contracts from Ethereum Code, and they allow users to represent unique items as Ethereum based assets. Basically, they act like a deed and prove that the item you are selling, or sharing, is in fact yours. These coins can have only one owner at a time and are worth one USD each, and they are only created by you.</p>
                    <p>Unlike paper money, you can’t create new NFT’s or bring them into existence unless you own what is being sold. Each NFT is digitally unique and needs to have a verified owner that can be cross-referenced and checked before any trading is done.</p>

                <p class="fs-22"><b>The main benefits of NFT’s are their compatibility with the entirety of the Ethereum Code market. The easiest way to illustrate the benefits would be with an example. </b></p>
                <p class="fs-22">You spend three NFT to purchase a ticket to a concert and now have the Ethereum built ticket. That ticket isn’t just a ticket anymore, it’s another form of currency that you can use on anything Ethereum built through Ethereum Code. Let’s say that a few days later you see an art piece that you really like.</p>
                <p class="fs-22">Rather than having to find enough Ether and NFT to make the trade work, you can approach the vendor and ask to trade your ticket for the Ethereum built art piece. Since both pieces were built using Ethereum, they can easily be traded. You can even use these pieces in different ways.</p>
                <p class="fs-22">If a bank is compatible and uses Ethereum Code, you can use that bought art piece which is normally worth $100, or 100 NFT, as a decentralized loan! There’s a lot that you can do with the flexibility that Ethereum offers you, and as the creator, you retain total ownership of the work.</p>
                <p class="fs-22">If the item is unique and requires provable ownership, it can be used for trading with NFT’s and Ethereum.</p>

            <p><b>As with any cryptocurrency, there is a bit of a learning curve and a paradigm shift as to how you think about your money. Here are some of the frequently asked questions that we see on a daily basis.</b></p>

                    <div class="acor-body12">
                        <p>Ethereum Code is an open-source project, and it is simultaneously owned by no one and everyone at the same time. It isn’t backed by anything, except for its users who all swear by it. While some users are pushed to get the cryptocurrency backed by something, so far it is free and open source.</p>

                    <div class="acor-body12">
                        <p>A gas limit is one of the three pillars that Ether stands on, with price and cost being the other two. Gas limits are set whenever you write your programs for the trading robot, and they denote exactly how much you want to spend to complete a transaction. Gas limits work a lot like a budget, where you can stay that you only want to spend 500 ether on any transaction. If a transaction costs 600, then the smart AI should stay away from it.
                        </p>

                    <div class="acor-body12">
                        <p>While Bitcoin undoubtedly came first, neither one is really better than the other. Bitcoin came first, so it’s very integrated into the world of cryptocurrency, and Ethereum was born out of the disadvantages that Bitcoin has. While Bitcoin is just a cryptocurrency, Ethereum Code uses smart contracts to become much more. It’s a decentralized program that can be customized and adapted for just about anything.
                        </p>
                        <p>Neither one is better than the other, it just depends on what you need and want from your cryptocurrency. If you want a standard and no-frills currency that everyone has heard about, then Bitcoin can work the best for you. For more customizability and versatility, go with the Ethereum Code.</p>
